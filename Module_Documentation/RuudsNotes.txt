Hi!

Below I have collected most of the online documentation I am using to create my very own modplayer.
I am doing this with Lazarus-IDE, so with FPC (FreePascal).

Note please that the documentation is very helpfull, but does not cover all the details. I've been
testing/comparing/trying different 'tweaks' to the player going on as much files as is possible.

My initial sound files used are those from Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies. These files run
all OK now.


Interesting internet resources for fileformat / player logic information:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD_%28file_format%29
ftp://ftp.modland.com/pub/documents/format_documentation/FireLight%20MOD%20Player%20Tutorial.txt
http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Amiga_Module
https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Protracker_Module#Axy


Also I looked at a few other modplayers outthere:

JavaMod:
http://www.javamod.de/

OpenMPT:
https://openmpt.org/

The latter also has a nice effect reference online:
https://wiki.openmpt.org/Manual:_Effect_Reference

Also they have some testing MODs available:
https://wiki.openmpt.org/Development:_Test_Cases/MOD


About the testing MODs:
I am not pursuing to get these testing files to work 'properly' per se. My goal with the player is
not to be max. compatible with other players outthere. Instead I am interested in trying to adhere
to the descriptions of the effects, and have most MODs play OK: kind of a mix in between. Including
errors because other players have them, is therefore not a goal. Instead, I try to prevent such
errors. Though I am aware I am probably creating some errors of my own in the meantime.. ;-)

Another goal is to keep a small codebase, while also not using external libraries. Expanding the
player to also be able to play newer types module files (see openMPT) is not on the wishlist per se,
since I'd like to keep things simple as stated above.


About PAL/NTSC:
Since module files depend upon the right speed when running to sound right (no distortions) I was
searching the net to see if the PAL/NTSC choice would be encoded in the MOD files. Unfortunately
this seems not to be the case. Since the Amiga computers were sold primarily in Europe (much
less so in America), PAL is the best default 'speed' to use: not NTSC. Of course the user can
manually switch between the two on the fly..

Have fun with this stuff!
